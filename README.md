## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
# About me

I am a recent Concordia Bootcamp graduate looking for my next challenge. Having previously studied and worked in Business/Finance, I decided to change course and take on this new journey.

I chose this path because of its limitless opportunities and how passionate I am about it.  Although fresh in the field, I am a quick learner that catches up very fast. 

Having worked in a fanancial instition in the past few years and a communications company before that, I bring valuable skills such as the ability to work in a team, effective communication (with both clinets and teammates), working in a fast pace environment and knowledge of financial processes. 

I am also fluent ion both English and French.
